Below is the workflow for having your contribution accepted into the ``pattoo-web`` repository.

#. Create an Issue or comment on an existing issue to discuss the feature
#. If the feature is approved, assign the issue to yourself
#. Fork the project
#. Clone the fork to your local machine
#. Run ``make setup`` to install dependencies to virtualenv (information about virtualenv found further below in this doc)
#. Add the original project as a remote (git remote add upstream https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/pattoo-web, check with: git remote -v)
#. Create a topic branch for your change (git checkout -b ``BranchName``\ )
#. You may create additional branches if modifying multiple parts of the code
#. Write code and Commit your changes locally. Example proper git commit message below:

.. code-block::

    Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete ...

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.

    Resolves Issue: #123
    See also: #456, #789


#. When you need to synch with upstream (pull the latest changes from main repo into your current branch), do:
   #. ``git fetch upstream``
   #. ``git merge upstream/master`` (or run ``make synch`` to let the projects makefile handle synching)
#. Check for unnecessary white space with ``git diff --check``.
#. Write the necessary unit tests for your changes.
#. Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken (run: ``make test``\ )
#. Push your changes to your forked repository (git push origin ``branch``\ )
#. Perform a pull request on GitHub
#. Your code will be reviewed
#. If your code passes review, your pull request will be accepted

The ``make contribute`` command encapsulates steps 8 to 12 when you are ready to make a pull request.
The ``make synch`` command will synch your repository

Code Style Guide
================

For ease of readability and maintainability ``pattoo-web`` code must follow these guidelines. Code that does not comply will not be added to the ``master`` branch.

#. ``pattoo-web`` uses the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Exceptions>`_ for general style requirements
#. ``pattoo-web`` uses the The Chromium Projects Python Style Guidelines for docstrings.
#. Indentations must be multiples of 4 blank spaces. No tabs.
#. All strings must be enclosed in single quotes
#. In addition too being pylint compliant, the code must be PEP8 and PEP257 compliant too.
#. There should be no trailing spaces in files

Guidelines to remember
----------------------

* Always opt for the most pythonic solution to a problem
* Avoid applying idioms from other programming languages
* Import each module with its full path name. ie: from pack.subpack import module
* `Use exceptions where appropriate <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Exceptions>`_
* `Use doc strings <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
* Try not to have returns at multiple points in a function unless they are failure state returns.
* If you are in the middle of a development session and have to interrupt your work, it is a good idea to write a broken unit test about what you want to develop next. When coming back to work, you will have a pointer to where you were and get back on track faster.

Commits
-------

``pattoo-web`` strives to maintain a proper log of development through well structured git commits. The links below offer insight and advice on the topic of commit messages:

#. http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

PEP8 and PEP257 Compliance
--------------------------

You can verify your code for compliance using running the ``make lint`` command from the project root.

VirtualEnv
----------

``virtualenv`` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.
It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesnâ€™t share libraries with other virtualenv environments nor does it access the globally installed libraries either.

* The ``pattoo-web`` project's ``makefile`` will automatically set up a ``makefile`` for you once you have virutalenv installed globally.
* All dependencies that ``pattoo-web`` requires, aside from ``pip`` and ``virtualenv`` itself, will be installed to this virtual env.
* The makefile will run commands such as ``nosetests`` from the virtual env. If you wish to run these commands manually, run them as ``venv/bin/nosetests`` as they would not have been installed to your machine globally.

Makefile
--------

This project contains a makefile which contains a list of utilities that can be run using the ``make command`` command.
The list of commands is:


* dependencies - install project dependencies
* setup - same as dependencies, exists for convention
* lint - run pep8 pep257 and pylint on the project. (these can be run individually aswell, ie ``make pep8``\ )
* test - run nosetests
* develop - create pattoo-web executable in /venv/bin/pattoo-web and /bin/pattoo-web
* clean - remove all files and directories created by any other make command(ie venv)
* synch - Pull down updates from the master branch of official repo into current branch of forked repo
* contribute - Set up repository for making pull request

Sample .vimrc File for Compliance
---------------------------------

You can use this sample .vimrc file to help meet our style requirements

.. code-block::

   " Activate syntax
   syntax on
   " set number

   " Disable automatic comment insertion
   autocmd FileType * setlocal formatoptions-=c formatoptions-=r formatoptions-=o

   " Delete trailing whitespace
   autocmd BufWritePre * :%s/\s\+$//e

   " Convert tabs to spaces
   set expandtab

   " Set tabs to 4 spaces
   set tabstop=4

   " Set the number of spaces for indentation
   set shiftwidth=4

   " Switch on highlighting the last used search pattern when the terminal has colors
   if &t_Co > 2 || has("gui_running")
     set hlsearch
   endif

   " Tell vim to remember certain things when we exit
   "  '10  :  marks will be remembered for up to 10 previously edited files
   "  "100 :  will save up to 100 lines for each register
   "  :20  :  up to 20 lines of command-line history will be remembered
   "  %    :  saves and restores the buffer list
   "  n... :  where to save the viminfo files
   set viminfo='10,\"100,:20,%,n~/.viminfo

   " Function for viminfo to work
   function! ResCur()
     if line("'\"") <= line("$")
       normal! g`"
       return 1
     endif
   endfunction

   " Function for viminfo to work
   augroup resCur
     autocmd!
     autocmd BufWinEnter * call ResCur()
   augroup END
